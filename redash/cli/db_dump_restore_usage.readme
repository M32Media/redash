For these scripts to work:

- No users should be using the redash database

- you need to invoke them as the redash user (likea majority of the other scripts)

- You also need to make sure the redash user can read and write files in the directory 

- finally that the redash user can create a database in psql. (You can add that permission with ALTER USER redash CREATEDB)

- After having followed these steps everything should be fine.
