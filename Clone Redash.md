# How to clone a Redash instance

## Creating an instance

Start from a snapshot already taken or create a screenshot of a machine you want as a baseline. The reference we have now is na1apiredash-m32-report-20201029-readytoclone but it can change in the future and we must update this document every time it does.

Create an instance starting from the screenshot, with the following specs:

* Location: northamerica-northeast1 (Montreal)
* 6 vCPUs
* 30GB of RAM

## Cloning data

The snapshot contains a baseline for these 3 clients:

* Cogeco: Segment and Revenue
* DomaineBleu: Revenue and traffic
* Textuel: is Revenue only
